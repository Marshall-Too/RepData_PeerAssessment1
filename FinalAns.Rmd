- *Ans 6* - Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends      

### **Data Summary** 

This is simply the code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data  
  
Answers can be found from Step 2 onwards  


```{r, echo = TRUE}
setwd("~/R/RepData_PeerAssessment1/")
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Exploring the basics of this data
```{r, message = FALSE}

dim(activity)
names(activity)
head(activity)
str(activity)
#total number of missing data
sum(is.na(activity$steps))/dim(activity)[[1]]
#transforming the date column into date format using lubridate
library(lubridate)
activity$date<-ymd(activity$date)
length(unique(activity$date))
```


### Ans 1
The Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day is shown below

```{r ggplot3, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}


Q2 <- data.frame(tapply(activity$steps,activity$date,sum,na.rm=TRUE))

Q2$date <-as.Date(rownames(Q2),'%Y-%m-%d')
library(ggplot2)
rownames(Q2) <-NULL
names(Q2)[[1]] <-"Total Steps"


#Total Steps by date bar chart
ggplot(Q2,aes(y=`Total Steps`,x=date))+geom_bar(stat="identity")  + 
        theme_light() +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
        ylab("Total Steps")+xlab("Date")+ggtitle("Total Steps by date") +
       scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%M-%Y") 


```


### Ans 2

Mean and median number of steps taken each day

```{r, echo = TRUE}

library(dplyr)

activity_total_steps <- with(activity, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(activity_total_steps) <- c("date", "steps")

```


This is the average/mean of the total number of steps taken per day:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(activity_total_steps$steps)
```

This is the median of the total number of steps taken per day:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
median(activity_total_steps$steps)
```


### Ans 3
Average number of steps taken (averaged across all days) versus the 5-minute intervals plot is shown below

```{r ggplot, echo = TRUE}
Q4 <-  aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE) 
names(Q4) <- c("Intervals","Steps")
Q4$Intervals = as.numeric(as.character(Q4$Intervals))

Q4plot <- ggplot(Q4,aes(x= Intervals,y=Steps)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=1)) + geom_point() + #group needs to be indicated since intervals is a factor
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,2500, by = 500)) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  ylab("Mean Steps Every day") +
  xlab("Intervals")+ggtitle("Mean Steps by 5 Min Intervals")

Q4plot
```


### Ans 4  
The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#This is assuming that the words on average means averaging steps by date and interval
Q5 = Q4[which.max(Q4$Steps), 'Intervals']
print(Q5)
```

'The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps is `r Q5`.'

### Ans 5  

In this datset, there are a number of days with missing values which may introduce bias. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
Q6 <- activity
Q6$Missing <-is.na(Q6$steps)
sum(Q6$Missing)
```

'The total number of rows with NA (missing values) is `r sum(Q6$Missing)`.'
  
I decide to fill in the missing values based on the **average** steps value at **each interval**  
  
For example, we find at interval 5, the average steps taken each day is five  
  
Hence, if we identify a missing value at interval = 5 on any day, we will replace this missing value with five


```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(zoo)

Q6 <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate(steps = ifelse(is.na(steps), 
                                            mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                            steps)) %>% ungroup()

```
  
The revised histogram, after filling in missing values, is shown below.    
  
```{r ggplot4, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

Q6$interval = as.numeric(as.character(Q6$interval))
                         
ggplot(Q6, aes(x=interval,y=steps)) +
  geom_histogram(stat='identity') + 
  ggtitle("Steps by 5 Min Intervals After Missing Values Replaced")
```
  
The revised mean and median total number of steps taken per day are summarized below:

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
revisedQ2 =  data.frame(tapply(Q6$steps,Q6$date,sum,na.rm=TRUE))
colnames(revisedQ2) = 'steps'

med_old = median(activity_total_steps$steps)
med_new = round(as.numeric(median(revisedQ2$steps)),0)
mean_old = mean(activity_total_steps$steps)
mean_new = round(as.numeric(mean(revisedQ2$steps)),0)
```

'After replacing missing values, the median has **increased** from `r med_old` to `r med_new`.'  
  
'After replacing missing values, the mean has **increased**  from `r mean_old` to `r mean_new`.'  
  
  
This **increase** is expected given we are replacing missing values, initially zero, with an additional value.  

### Ans 6
Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(timeDate)

Q7 = Q6 %>% mutate(Weekday = if_else(isWeekday(date), 'Weekday', 'Weekend'))
print.data.frame(Q7)
```
  
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the   average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).  
  
```{r, echo = TRUE}

averageStepByDayTypeAndInterval<- Q7 %>%
  group_by(Weekday, interval) %>%
  summarize(averageStepByDay=sum(steps))

library(lattice)
with(averageStepByDayTypeAndInterval, 
      xyplot(averageStepByDay ~ interval | Weekday, 
      type = "l",      
      main = "Total Number of Steps within Intervals by dayType",
      xlab = "Daily Intervals",
      ylab = "Average Number of Steps"))

```
